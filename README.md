## Running the project with Firebase

To use this project with Firebase authentication, some configuration steps are required.

- Create a new project with the Firebase console.
- Add iOS and Android apps in the Firebase project settings.
- On iOS, you must set a bundle ID. As a recommendation, if your thinking of releasing the app on iOS, you should have an [Apple Developer Program Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/) and [create an app](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/bundleId) on your profile. Here you will setup your bundle ID validated by Apple, that you should also use on the Firebase Configuration.
- then, [download and copy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup#configure_an_ios_app) `GoogleService-Info.plist` into `iOS/Runner`, and add it to the Runner target in Xcode.
- On Android, define the package name as your preference, a good practice is to use as name the bundle ID defined on iOS (a SHA-1 certificate fingerprint is also needed for Google sign-in).
- then, [download and copy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup#configure_an_android_app) `google-services.json` into `android/app`.

See this document for full instructions:

- [https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)

Additional setup instructions for Google, Apple and Facebook sign-in:

- Google Sign-In on iOS: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/google-signin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/ios/google-signin)
- Google Sign-In on Android: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/google-signin)
- Facebook Login for Android: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android)
- Facebook Login for iOS: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios)
- Apple Sign-in: [https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple](https://pub.dev/packages/sign_in_with_apple)

Firebase Crashlytics Testing:
- To test the crash reporting, the app be can forced crash using following line:
     `FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.crash();`
     Above line can be put anywhere where we want the crash to happen.
- Crash reporting happens only when the app is restarted after a crash.
- Goto Crashlytics in Firebase project. Wait for sometime as it can take a few minutes for crashes to appear.
- Flutter package: https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_crashlytics
- Learn more: https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/crashlytics/overview/

Firebase Analytics:
- To log an event use [get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) service locator instance and get `AnalyticsService`. The `AnalyticsService` class has a method named `logEvent` which can be extended to add another analytics service other than Firebase.
- After configuring Firebase Analytics correctly, it can take some minutes or some hours to show up the events in Analytics Dashboard of Firebase Console. To track the events nearly in rear-time, [DebugView](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/debugview) can be used.
- Flutter package: https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_analytics
- Learn more: https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/analytics/overview
