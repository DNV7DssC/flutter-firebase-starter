### Getting Started :muscle:

To use this project with Firebase, some configuration steps are required.

- Create a new project with the Firebase console.
- Add iOS and Android apps in the Firebase project settings.

See this [document][firebase_setup] for full instructions.

Crashlytics:

- To test the crash reporting, the app be can forced crash using following line:
  `FirebaseCrashlytics.instance.crash();`
  Above line can be put anywhere where we want the crash to happen.
- Crash reporting happens only when the app is restarted after a crash.
- Go to Crashlytics in the Firebase project. Wait for sometime as it can take a few minutes for crashes to appear.
- [Flutter package][crashlytics_package]
- [Learn more][crashlytics_learn_more]

Analytics:

- To log an event use [get_it][get_it_package] service locator instance and get `AnalyticsService`. The `AnalyticsService` is an abstract class which can be extended to add another analytics service.
- After configuring Firebase Analytics correctly, it can take some minutes or some hours to show up the events in Analytics Dashboard of Firebase Console. To track the events nearly in real-time, [debug view][analytics_debug_view] can be used.
- [Flutter package][analytics_package]
- [Learn more][analytics_learn_more]

Cloud messaging
- You can use push notifications and local notifications depending on the 3 possible states your app would be.
```dart
FirebaseMessaging.onMessage.listen((event) async {
  await _localNotificationService.showNotification();
});
FirebaseMessaging.onMessageOpenedApp.listen(
  (event) => _onNotificationChanged(event.data),
);
FirebaseMessaging.onBackgroundMessage(
  (message) => _onNotificationChanged(message.data),
);
```

Authentication:

- [Google Sign-In][google_sign_in_ios] on iOS
- [Google Sign-In][google_sign_in_android] on Android
- [Facebook Login][facebook_login_ios] on iOS
- [Facebook Login][facebook_login_android] on Android
- [Apple Sign-in][apple_sign_in]

Firestore

- Generic implementation of firestore methods: get, post, put, delete.
- Repository class interact with firestore persistence service
- [Flutter package][firestore_package]
- [Learn more][firestore_learn_more]

Storage

- Methods for upload and download a file from firebase storage.
```dart
  Future<void> uploadFile(File file, String storagePath);
  Future<String> downloadFile(String storagePath, String localPath);
  Future<String> downloadURL(String storagePath);
```
- [Flutter package][storage_package]
- [Learn more][storage_learn_more]

Dynamic links

- Invite new users to your app using dynamic links.
- Automatic login redirection inside the app.
- Paswordless sign-in.
- [Flutter package][dynamic_links_package]

Remote Config

- Example on how to use remote config to communicate users if the version of an app has increased. 
- [Flutter package][remote_config_package]
- [Learn more][remote_config_learn_more]

### Other Cool features :fire:

✅&nbsp; Internationalization

The configuration is on the yaml file on the root directory.
```yaml
arb-dir: lib/constants/l10n
template-arb-file: app_en.arb
output-localization-file: app_localizations.dart
```
You can add new languages each one should have its own file. E.g:
```yaml
{
  "helloWorld": "Hello World!",
  "@helloWorld": {
    "description": "Somnio Software loves Flutter"
  }
}
```

✅&nbsp; [Shared Preferences][shared_preferences_package]
A providing persistent storage for simple data.

✅&nbsp; [Image Picker][image_picker_package]
You can take pick images from the library or take photos to update you user profile picture.

✅&nbsp; [Onboarding][onboarding_package]
Basic example of an onboarding flow where you can explain users a little explanation about the app.

✅&nbsp; [Splash Screen][splash_screen_package]

You can easily configure and cusotmize the splash screen in the pubspec.yaml.
```yaml
flutter_native_splash:
  color: "#42a5f5"
  image: assets/somnio_logo.png
  color_dark: "#042a49"
  image_dark: assets/somnio_logo.png
  web: false
```

✅&nbsp; Flavors

We have defined 3 differents flavors or development enviroments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production
  Each of these flavor will use a different firebase project. You can add `google-services.json`(Android) and `GoogleService-info.plist`(iOS) for each flavor in following locations:
  - Android:
    - `android/app/src/dev`
    - `android/app/src/staging`
    - `android/app/src/prod`
  - iOS:
    - `ios/config/dev`
    - `ios/config/staging`
    - `ios/config/prod`
  - Note: For iOS, XCode might not be able to find the files from above locations if you simply copy it there. You need to drag and drop or use Add Files option by right clicking the folder to make sure that they are added to Runner target.
- You can use each flavor as follows:
  - You can run this command in Terminal: `flutter run --flavor FLAVOR_NAME` where FLAVOR_NAME can be replaced with either one of `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`.
  - We have also provided the launch configuration for VSCode which you can view from the menu: `Run > Open Configurations`
  - You can easily switch between different configuratons from the Status bar in VSCode.
- You can get current flavor in Flutter by using `getCurrentFlavor()` method from `AppInfo` class.
